Hello World!

I am a fifty year old retiree. Over the last 25 years I have had a burning desire to advance my very limited technology acumen.
as of July 2019 I have been personally satisfying the hungry. In that time I have built my own Lab with 3 physical servers towers and blades
alike. I have been deep diving in Linux all flavors at one point and only recently constructively settling in on my researched favorites.
I have been studing in great detail from Networks, and actual servers (the software) to now settling in on my very first programming language.
Wish me luck.
